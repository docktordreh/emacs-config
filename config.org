* Introduction

Editor war! The desk of software developers is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless Sith Lord, Doom.

There are heroes on both sides. [[github:emacs-evil/evil][Evil]] is everywhere.

** Emacs vs Vim
<<sec:emacs-vs-vim>>
For a long time, using vim was more than enough for me.
But as an IDE/edit-everything editor, emacs works far better for me. The emacs ecosystem is a big part of why I prefer
it over vim, especially [[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs/org-mode.git][org-mode]].

Since [[github:doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom]] comes with vim keybinds by default, it is easy to adapt to emacs.


** Emacs ecosystem

Although I mentioned in [[sec:emacs-vs-vim][the previous section]] that emacs is an editor, [[https://www.eigenbahn.com/2020/01/12/emacs-is-no-editor][it certainly is not]].

#+begin_quote
It is far more apt to describe Emacs as /a Lisp machine providing a generic user-centric text manipulation environment/.
--- tecosaur
#+end_quote

[[xkcd:378]]

Emacs can be used for/as:
- Task planning
- Project management
- Email client
- Git frontend
- scraping recipes from websites
- interacting with a REST service
- and more

This /editor/ exists for more than 40 years for now and people have built wonderful software for the integrated Lisp interpreter.

** Disclaimer

This configuration is inspired (and a lot of it directly copied, although
development of it will change that over time) by the wonderful work of [[github:tecosaur/emacs-config][tecosaur]]. Check out his work first.

* Rudimentary configuration
** Confpkg
*** Motivation

Previously, all of my configuration was directly tangled into =config.el=. This
/almost/ satisfies my use. Occasionally though, I'd want to apply or extract a
/specific bit/ of my config in an elisp script, such as some of my Org-export
customisations. This is a hassle, either loading my entire config (of which 90%
simply complicates the state), or manually copying the relevant code in pieces,
one source block at a time (just a different kind of hassle). While I'd like to
think my config is "greater than the sum of its parts", much of it can be safely
clumped into self-contained packets of functionality.

One afternoon I thought "wouldn't it be nice if I could just load a few of those
self-contained chunks of my config", then I started thinking about how I could
have that /and/ =config.el=. This is the result.

*** Design

It's already natural to organise blocks of config under sections, and we can use
=:noweb-ref= with a =header-args:emacs-lisp= property to direct all child source
blocks into a single parent. We could have two parents, one tangling to
=subconf/config-X.el= and the other to =config.el=, however this will duplicate
any evaluations required to generate the content, which isn't great
(particularly for things which take a moment, like checking for LaTeX
packages). Instead we can /just/ write to the =subconf/*= files and then at the
end of tangling extract their contents into =config.el=.

#+begin_src dot :file misc/confpkg.svg :results file graphics
digraph {
    graph [bgcolor="transparent"];
    node  [shape="underline" penwidth="2" style="rounded,filled" fillcolor="#efefef" color="#c9c9c9" fontcolor="#000000" fontname="Alegreya Sans"];
    edge  [color="#aaaaaa" penwidth="1.2" fontname="Alegreya Sans"]
    rankdir="LR"
    "config.org" [color="#4db5bd"]
    "config.el" [color="#e69055"]
    node[color="#a991f1"]
    "subconf/config-magit.el"
    "subconf/config-org.el"
    "subconf/config-?.el"
    node[color="#51afef"]
    "config.org" -> "Magit#src1" -> "subconf/config-magit.el" -> "config.el"
    "config.org" -> "Magit#src2" -> "subconf/config-magit.el"
    "config.org" -> "Org#src1" -> "subconf/config-org.el" -> "config.el"
    "config.org" -> "Org#src2" -> "subconf/config-org.el"
    "config.org" -> "Org#..." -> "subconf/config-org.el"
    "config.org" -> "(etc.)#..." -> "subconf/config-?.el" -> "config.el"
}

#+RESULTS:
[[file:misc/confpkg.svg]]

To set this up within each section, instead of manually repeating a common form
we can generate the form and supply the relevant section properties via a babel
call keyword, like so:

#+begin_src org
,* Subject

,#+call: confpkg("subject")

,#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Code that configures the subject...
,#+end_src
#+end_src

This isn't entirely straightforward, but with some mild abuse of noweb and babel
we can make it work!

*** Preparation

This approach is built around =#+call= invocations that affect the tangling.
Unfortunately for this use-case, babel call keywords are not executed on tangle.
Tangled noweb blocks /are/ however, and so we can fudge the behaviour we want by
tangling a noweb block to a temp file, with a noweb block that executes babel
calls in the buffer.

#+name: confpkg-prepare
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(condition-case nil
    (progn
      (message "Intitialising confpkg")
      <<bootstrap>>
      (org-fold-core-ignore-fragility-checks
        (org-babel-map-executables nil
          (when (eq (org-element-type (org-element-context)) 'babel-call)
            (org-babel-lob-execute-maybe)))))
  (quit (revert-buffer t t t)))
#+end_src

See the [[Bootstrap]] section for an explanation of the =<<bootstrap>>= noweb reference.

#+header: :tangle (expand-file-name (make-temp-name "emacs-org-babel-excuses/confpkg-prepare-") temporary-file-directory)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export :mkdirp yes :export-embed no
<<confpkg-prepare()>>
#+end_src

*** Setup

Before generating the template with babel, we want to keep track of:
+ How many config groups are created
+ Information about each config group

To do this we can simply create two variables. Due to temp-buffer shenanigans,
we'll have to use global variables here.

Then we need to set up the two final phases of this process:
+ Creating =config.el=
+ Cleaning up the superfluous generated content

To trigger the final phases we'll add a hook to ~org-babel-post-tangle-hook~. Once
again, it would be preferred if this was done locally, but it needs to be
global. To avoid this causing headaches down the line we'll make sure when
implementing the hook function to have it remove itself from the hook when
executed.

#+name: confpkg-setup
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent :noweb no-export
(setq confpkg--num 0
      confpkg--list nil)

<<confpkg-dependency-analysis>>
<<confpkg-strip-package-statements>>
<<confpkg-create-config>>
(defun confpkg-cleanup ()
 <<confpkg-cleanup>>
  )
<<confpkg-finaliser>>

<<confpkg-clear-old-files>>

(add-hook 'org-babel-tangle-finished-hook #'confpkg-tangle-finalise)
#+end_src

To avoid generating cruft, it would also be good to get rid of old tangled
config files at the start.

#+name: confpkg-clear-old-files
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(make-directory "subconf" t)
(dolist (conf-file (directory-files "subconf" t "config-.*\\.el"))
  (delete-file conf-file))
#+end_src

Now to have this take effect, we can just use a babel call keyword. Thanks to
the preparation step this will be executed during tangling.

#+call: confpkg-setup[:results none]()

*** Package generation

Now we actually implement the =confpkg= babel function. We could just direct the
output into the =subconf/config-X.el= file without any extra steps, but why not be
a bit fancier and make it more like a package.

To do this, we'll have =confpkg= load a template and then fill it in using
~format-spec~. To make sure this is actually used, we'll call ~org-set-property~ to
modify the parent heading, and register the config group with the variables we
created earlier.

Now all that's needed is a template to be used.

;;  Generated package (no.%n) from my config.

;;  This is liable to have unstated dependencies, and reply on other bits of

#+end_src

This currently makes the included content look much more package-like that in
truly is. However, I hope that some static analysis in future will allow for
dependency information to be collected and included.

Lastly, should there be an issue or interruption, it's possible that the
modifications from =#+call: confpkg= may persist. If I've been good with my
committing, resolving this should be as simple as reverting unstaged changes.
So... back in reality, it would be nice to have a way to clean up =confpkg=
residue.

#+name: confpkg-cleanup
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
(org-fold-core-ignore-fragility-checks
  (org-babel-map-executables nil
    (when (and (eq (org-element-type (org-element-context)) 'babel-call)

#+end_src

*** Identify cross-package dependencies
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :noweb-ref confpkg-dependency-analysis
:END:

At a basic level, we can search for regexp expressions indicating the definition
of functions or variables and search for their usage.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun confpkg--rough-extract-definitions (file)
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents file)
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (let (symbols)
      (while (re-search-forward
              (rx line-start (* (any ?\s ?\t)) "("
                  (or "defun" "defmacro" "defsubst" "defgeneric" "defalias" "defvar" "defcustom" "defface" "deftheme"
                      "cl-defun" "cl-defmacro" "cl-defsubst" "cl-defmethod" "cl-defstruct" "cl-defgeneric" "cl-deftype")
                  (+ (any ?\s ?\t))
                  (group (+ (any "A-Z" "a-z" "0-9"
                                 ?+ ?- ?* ?/ ?_ ?~ ?! ?@ ?$ ?% ?^ ?& ?= ?: ?< ?> ?{ ?})))
                  (or blank ?\n))
              nil t)
        (push (match-string 1) symbols))
      symbols)))
#+end_src

Continuing our rough regexp approach, we can construct a similar function to
look for uses of symbols.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun confpkg--rough-uses-p (file symbols)
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents file)
    (let ((symbols (copy-sequence symbols)) uses-p)
      (while symbols
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (if (re-search-forward (rx word-start (literal (car symbols)) word-end) nil t)
            (setq uses-p t symbols nil)
          (setq symbols (cdr symbols))))
      uses-p)))
#+end_src

Now we can put these two functions together to annotate ~confpkg--list~ with their
(confpkg) dependencies.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun confpkg-annotate-list-dependencies ()
  (dolist (confpkg confpkg--list)
    (plist-put confpkg :defines
               (confpkg--rough-extract-definitions
                (plist-get confpkg :file))))
  (dolist (confpkg confpkg--list)
    (let ((after (plist-get confpkg :after))
          requires)
      (dolist (other-confpkg confpkg--list)
        (when (and (not (eq other-confpkg confpkg))
                   (confpkg--rough-uses-p (plist-get confpkg :file)
                                          (plist-get other-confpkg :defines)))
          (push (plist-get other-confpkg :package) requires)))
      (when (and after (symbolp after))
        (push after requires))
      (plist-put confpkg :requires requires))))
#+end_src

Finally, we can use this information to edit the confpkg files to add the
necessary ~require~ statements.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun confpkg-write-dependencies ()
  (dolist (confpkg confpkg--list)
    (when (plist-get confpkg :requires)
      (with-temp-buffer
        (setq buffer-file-name (plist-get confpkg :file))
        (insert-file-contents buffer-file-name)
        (re-search-forward "^;;; Code:\n")
        (insert "\n")
        (dolist (req (plist-get confpkg :requires))
          (insert (format "(require '%s)\n" req)))
        (write-region nil nil buffer-file-name)
        (set-buffer-modified-p nil)))))
#+end_src

*** Commenting out ~package!~ statements

It's easy enough to set ~package!~ statements to tangle to =packages.el=, however
with our noweb ref approach they will /also/ go to the config files. This could be
viewed as a problem, but I actually think it's rather nice to have the package
information with the config. So, we can look for an immediate ~package!~ statement
and simply comment it out. As a bonus, we can also then record which packages
are needed for each block of config.

#+name: confpkg-strip-package-statements
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun confpkg-comment-out-package-statements ()
  (dolist (confpkg confpkg--list)
    (with-temp-buffer
      (setq buffer-file-name (plist-get confpkg :file))
      (insert-file-contents buffer-file-name)
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (re-search-forward "^;;; Code:\n[[:space:]\n]*(\\(package!\\|unpin!\\)[[:space:]\n]+\\([^[:space:]]+\\)\\b" nil t)
        (plist-put confpkg :package-statements
                   (nconc (plist-get confpkg :package-statements)
                          (list (match-string 2))))
        (let* ((start (progn (beginning-of-line) (point)))
               (end (progn (forward-sexp 1)
                           (if (looking-at "[\t ]*;.*")
                               (line-end-position)
                             (point))))
               (contents (buffer-substring start end))
               paste-start paste-end
               (comment-start ";")
               (comment-padding "   ")
               (comment-end ""))
          (delete-region start (1+ end))
          (re-search-backward "^;;; Code:")
          (beginning-of-line)
          (insert ";;  Package statement:\n")
          (setq paste-start (point))
          (insert contents)

*** Creating the config file

After all the subconfig files have been tangled, we need to collect their
content and put them together into =config.el=. For this, all that's needed is a
function to go through the registered config groups and put their content in a
tempbuffer. We can call this with the finalising step.

Applying lexical binding to the config file is good for a number of reasons,
among which it's (slightly) faster than dynamic binding (see [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/12/22/][this blog post]] for
more info).

*** Quieter output

All the babel evaluation here ends up being quite noisy (along with a few other
things during tangle), let's see if we can change that.

#+name: confpkg-quieter-output
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when noninteractive
  (unless (fboundp 'doom-shut-up-a)
    (defun doom-shut-up-a (fn &rest args)
      (let ((standard-output #'ignore)
            (inhibit-message t))
        (apply fn args))))
  (advice-add 'org-babel-expand-body:emacs-lisp :around #'doom-shut-up-a)

*** Reporting load time information

#+call: confpkg("Confpkg timings")

When generating the config we added a form to collect load-time information.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar confpkg-load-time-tree (list (list 'root)))
(defvar confpkg-record-branch (list 'root))
(defvar confpkg-record-num 0)
#+end_src

It would be good to process ~confpkg-load-times~ at the end to make it more
useful, and provide a function to display load time information from it. This is
to aid in identification of confpkgs that take particularly long to load, and
thus would benefit from some attention.

To extract the per-confpkg load times, we can just take the difference in
~(float-time)~ and exclude the first entry.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun confpkg-create-record (name elapsed &optional parent enclosing)
  (let ((parent (assoc (or parent (car confpkg-record-branch))
                       confpkg-load-time-tree))
        (record (cons name (list (list 'self
                                       :name (format "%s" name)
                                       :num (cl-incf confpkg-record-num)
                                       :elapsed elapsed
                                       :enclosing enclosing)))))
    (push record confpkg-load-time-tree)
    (push record (cdr parent))
    record))

(defun confpkg-start-record (name &optional parent)
  (let ((record (confpkg-create-record name 0.0e+NaN parent t)))
    (plist-put (cdadr record) :start (float-time))
    (push name confpkg-record-branch)
    record))

(defun confpkg-finish-record (name)
  (let ((self-record (cdar (last (cdr (assoc name confpkg-load-time-tree))))))
    (plist-put self-record :elapsed
               (- (float-time) (plist-get self-record :start) 0.0))
    (unless (equal (car confpkg-record-branch) name)
      (message "Warning: Confpkg timing record expected to finish %S, instead found %S. %S"
               name (car confpkg-record-branch) confpkg-record-branch))
    (setq confpkg-record-branch (cdr confpkg-record-branch))))
#+end_src

A convenience macro could be nice to have.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defmacro confpkg-with-record (name &rest body)
  "Create a time record around BODY.
The record must have a NAME."
  (declare (indent 1))
  (let ((name-val (make-symbol "name-val"))
        (record-spec (make-symbol "record-spec")))
    `(let* ((,name-val ,name)
            (,record-spec (if (consp ,name-val) ,name-val (list ,name-val))))
       (apply #'confpkg-start-record ,record-spec)
       (unwind-protect
           (progn ,@body)
         (confpkg-finish-record (car ,record-spec))))))
#+end_src

It would also be nice to collect some other load-time-related information.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! +require--log-timing-a (orig-fn feature &optional filename noerror)
  :around #'require
  (if (or (featurep feature)
          (eq feature 'cus-start) ; HACK Why!?!
          (assoc (format "require: %s" feature) confpkg-load-time-tree))
      (funcall orig-fn feature filename noerror)
    (confpkg-with-record (list (format "require: %s" feature)
                               (and (eq (car confpkg-record-branch) 'root)
                                    'requires))
      (funcall orig-fn feature filename noerror))))
#+end_src

At last, we'll go to some pains to make a nice result tabulation function.

I will readily admit that this function is absolutely horrible. I just spent an
evening adding to it till it worked then stopped touching it. Maybe in the
future I'll go back to it and try to clean up the implementation.

*** Finalise

At last, to clean up the content inserted by the babel calls we can just revert
the buffer. As long as ~org-babel-pre-tangle-hook~ hasn't been modified,
~save-buffer~ will be run at the start of the tangle process and so reverting will
take us back to just before the tangle started.

Since this is /the/ function added as the post-tangle hook, we also need to remove
the function from the hook and call the =config.el= creation function.

#+name: confpkg-finaliser
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun confpkg-tangle-finalise ()
  (remove-hook 'org-babel-tangle-finished-hook #'confpkg-tangle-finalise)
  (revert-buffer t t t)
  (confpkg-comment-out-package-statements)
  (confpkg-annotate-list-dependencies)
  (confpkg-create-config)
  (confpkg-write-dependencies)
  (message "Processed %s elisp files" (length confpkg--list)))
#+end_src

Within ~confpkg-tangle-finalise~ we carefully order each step so that
the most important steps go first, to minimise the impact should a particular
step fail.

*** Bootstrap

This system makes use of some recent commits introduced to Org, such as [[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs/org-mode.git/commit/?id=cb8bf4a0d][this
noweb expansion bugfix]] which will be included in Org 9.5.4. This is
problematic if using Emacs 28.2 or older, so to get around this we must go
through a bootstrap process.

[[xkcd:1739]]

To start with, we'll check if we are:
+ Running an Org version prior to 9.5.4
+ Running in a ~noninteractive~ session
+ Using an Org that's not installed in the user directory
+ In a session with the symbol ~exit!~ defined

#+name: bootstrap
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(let ((required-org-version "9.5.4")
      (standard-output t))
  (when (and (version< (org-version) required-org-version)
             (not (string-match-p (regexp-quote (expand-file-name "~"))
                                  (locate-library "org"))))
    (cond
     ((and noninteractive (fboundp 'exit!))
      (print! (warn (format "Detected conditions provoking a config bootstrap (Org %s)" (org-version))))
      (print! (start "Initiating bootstrap..."))
      <<bootstrap-perform>>
      )
     (t (message "Installed Org version %s is too old, %s is needed.\nRun \"doom sync\" to fix."
                 (org-version) required-org-version)))))
#+end_src

If these conditions are met, we can assume that the loaded Org version is
insufficient, and that it's likely a Emacs is currently running a command like
=doom sync=, and so it makes sense to perform the 3-step bootstrap.
1. Temporarily rename =config.org= to =config.original.org=.
2. Create a new =config.org= that when tangled results in Org being installed.
3. Swap back to the original =config.org=, and re-sync.

#+name: bootstrap-perform
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(print! (item "Temporarily relocating config.org to config.original.org"))
(rename-file "config.org" "config.original.org" t)
<<boostrap-create-transient-config>>
(print! (item "%s") (bold "Re-running sync"))
(exit! :restart) ; Re-run =doom sync= with the transient config.
#+end_src

With the approach worked out, we just need to generate a snipped that will
create a new =config.org= that when tangled:
+ Tangles our Org recipe to =packages.el=
+ Swaps back to the original =config.org=
+ Re-runs =doom sync=

#+name: boostrap-create-transient-config
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(print! (item "Creating minimal init.el"))

(let ((standard-output #'ignore))
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert
     ";;; init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-\n\n"
     (pp (quote
          <<bootstrap-init>>
          )))
    (write-region nil nil "init.el")))

(print! (item "Creating boostrap config.el"))

(let ((standard-output #'ignore))
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert
     (org-element-interpret-data
      (list
       '(keyword (:key "title" :value "Boostrap Stage 1 Config" :post-blank 1))
       `(src-block
         (:language "emacs-lisp"
          :value ,(pp (quote (progn
                               <<boostrap-transition>>
                               )))
          :name "bootstrap-transition"
          :post-blank 1))
       `(src-block
         (:language "emacs-lisp"
          :parameters
          ,(concat ":noweb no-export "
                   ":tangle (expand-file-name (make-temp-name \"emacs-org-babel-excuses/confpkg-prepare-\") temporary-file-directory) "
                   ":mkdirp yes")
          :value ,(concat "<<" ; Split to avoid (prematurely) creating a noweb reference.
                          "bootstrap-transition()"
                          ">>\n"))))))
    (write-region nil nil "config.org")))
#+end_src

For the bootstrap we need a minimal =init.el=, just the literate module should be
sufficient.

#+name: bootstrap-init
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(doom! :config literate)
#+end_src

This =config.org= simply provides an entry point for us to run elisp during
tangle. We just need to make use of it to install Org and re-sync the original
configuration.

#+name: boostrap-transition
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(setq standard-output t)

(print! (start "Starting second stage of the bootstrap."))
(print! (item "Creating minimal packages.el"))

(let ((standard-output #'ignore))
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert
     ";; -*- no-byte-compile: t; -*-\n\n"
     (pp (quote
          (package! org)
          )))
    (write-region nil nil "packages.el")))

(doom-packages-install)

(print! (item "Switching back to original config.org"))
(rename-file "config.original.org" "config.org" t)

(print! (item "%s") (bold "Re-running sync"))
(exit! :restart)
#+end_src

There we go, that should do the trick, so long as we call the =bootstrap= block at
the start of the tangle process. This is done by calling =bootstrap= within the
[[Preparation][confpkg preparation]] stage.

** Personal information

#+call: confpkg()

This information is used for example by ~GPG~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "Valentin Lechner"
      user-mail-address "valentin_lechner@dismail.de")
#+end_src

Speaking of ~GPG~, I want to use =~/.config/auth/authinfo.gpg= instead of the default in
=~/.emacs.d=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq auth-sources '("~/.config/auth/authinfo.gpg")
      auth-source-cache-expiry nil) ; default is 7200 (2h)
#+end_src
Since the final newline did mess with my ~~/.config/auth/authinfo.gpg~ for forge quite a lot
(it doesn't allow a final newline) I decided why not deactivate it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq require-final-newline nil)
#+end_src
** Better defaults

#+call: confpkg()

In Germany, our week starts on monday
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

Relative line numbers make it easy to use vim commands like ~12k~ to go up 12 lines.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
#+end_src

My files should always use =utf-8= encoding.
Additionally, in the subsection [[File encoding]], there is a nice configuration
which only displays the current file encoding in the modeline, if it is not ~utf-8~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq locale-coding-system 'utf-8)
(set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)
(set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
#+end_src

As for the whitespace/tabs debate, I use whitespaces.
I like to specify that tabs are just x spaces, depending on language.
My argument against tabs is that it is something you can't see in a
lot of editors or a lot of viewers, for example in a webpage, by
default. Usually, I would assume that there are spaces - but who
knows?

Also, [[https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/][programmers who use spaces earn more money.]]
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src


*** Windows

I find it rather handy to be asked which file I want to see after splitting
the window. Let's make that happen.

First, we'll enter the new window
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq evil-vsplit-window-right t
      evil-split-window-below t)
#+end_src

Then, we'll pull up the file prompt.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! prompt-for-buffer (&rest _)
  :after '(evil-window-split evil-window-vsplit)
  (find-file "."))
#+end_src


** Doom configuration
#+call: confpkg("Doom")


*** Modules
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:END:

Doom has this lovely /modular configuration base/ that takes a lot of work out of
configuring Emacs. Each module (when enabled) can provide a list of packages to
install (on ~doom sync~) and configuration to be applied. The modules can also
have flags applied to tweak their behaviour.

#+name: init.el
#+attr_html: :collapsed t
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el" :noweb no-export :noweb-ref none
;;; init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load in.
;; Press 'K' on a module to view its documentation, and 'gd' to browse its directory.

**** Structure

As you may have noticed by this point, this is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate]] configuration. Doom
has good support for this which we access though the ~literate~ module.

While we're in the src_elisp{:config} section, we'll use Dooms nicer defaults,
along with the bindings and smartparens behaviour (the flags aren't documented,
but they exist).

**** Fontset

Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom.
Here are the three important ones:

+ =doom-font=
+ =doom-variable-pitch-font=
+ =doom-big-font= -- used for =doom-big-font-mode=; use this for
  presentations or streaming.

They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or
xlfd font string.

For ligature-Support I use the Iosevka Font.
The main (=doom-font=) is a patched [[https://github.com/jsravn/iosevka-emacs][Iosevka Font]] (monospace).

**** Line numbers

Relative line numbers are fantastic for knowing how far away line numbers are,
then =ESC 12 <UP>= gets you exactly where you think.

*** Some helper macros

There are a few handy macros added by doom, namely
- ~load!~ for loading external ~.el~ files relative to this one
- ~use-package!~ for configuring packages
- ~add-load-path!~ for adding directories to the ~load-path~ where ~Emacs~ looks when
  you load packages with ~require~ or ~use-package~
- ~map!~ for binding new keys

*** Allow babel execution in CLI actions

In this config I sometimes generate code to include in my config.
This works nicely, but for it to work with =doom sync= et. al. I need to make sure
that Org doesn't try to confirm that I want to allow evaluation (I do!).

Thankfully Doom supports =$DOOMDIR/cli.el= file which is sourced every time a CLI
command is run, so we can just enable evaluation by setting
~org-confirm-babel-evaluate~ to ~nil~ there.
While we're at it, we should silence ~org-babel-execute-src-block~ to
avoid polluting the output.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle cli.el :noweb-ref none
;;; cli.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)

*** Elisp REPL

**** A fancy splash screen
#+call: confpkg("fancy-splash", prefix="")


Emacs can render an image as the splash screen, but I think we can do better
than just a completely static image. Since, SVG images in particular are
supported, we can use them as the basis for a fancier splash screen image setup
--- with themable, resizing images.

With the effort I'm putting into this, it would be nice to have a good image,
and [[https://github.com/MarioRicalde][@MarioRicalde]] came up with a cracker! He's also provided me with a nice
Emacs-style /E/. I was using the blackhole image, but when I stripped down the
splash screen to something more minimal I switched to just using the /E/.

If we want to make sure an image is themed, we can look for unrecognised hex
strings that are not greyscale (as greyscale can be expected in the form of a
transparent overlay).

Since we're going to be generating theme-specific versions of splash images, it
would be good to have a cache directory.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar fancy-splash-cache-dir (expand-file-name "theme-splashes/" doom-cache-dir))
#+end_src

To set up dynamic resizing, we'll use a list specifying the image height at
various frame-height thresholds, with a few extra bells and whistles (such as
the ability to change image too).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar fancy-splash-sizes
  `((:height 300 :min-height 50 :padding (0 . 2))
    (:height 250 :min-height 42 :padding (2 . 4))
    (:height 200 :min-height 35 :padding (3 . 3))
    (:height 150 :min-height 28 :padding (3 . 3))
    (:height 100 :min-height 20 :padding (2 . 2))
    (:height 75  :min-height 15 :padding (2 . 1))
    (:height 50  :min-height 10 :padding (1 . 0))
    (:height 1   :min-height 0  :padding (0 . 0)))
  "List of plists specifying image sizing states.
Each plist should have the following properties:
- :height, the height of the image
- :min-height, the minimum `frame-height' for image
- :padding, a `+doom-dashboard-banner-padding' (top . bottom) padding
  specification to apply
Optionally, each plist may set the following two properties:
- :template, a non-default template file
- :file, a file to use instead of template")
#+end_src

Now that's we've set up the customisation approach, we need to work out the
mechanics for actually implementing this. To start with, a basic utility
function to get the relevant file path.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun fancy-splash-filename (theme template height)
  "Get the file name for the splash image with THEME and of HEIGHT."
  (expand-file-name (format "%s-%s-%d.svg" theme (file-name-base template) height) fancy-splash-cache-dir))
#+end_src

Now to go about actually generating the images. To adjust the sizing on demand,
we will offer two mechanisms:
1. A special =$height= token which is replaced with the desired height
2. Recognition of =height=100=, in which case =100= will be replaced with the
   desired height and any =width= property will be removed.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun fancy-splash-generate-image (template height)
  "Create a themed image from TEMPLATE of HEIGHT.
The theming is performed using `fancy-splash-template-colours'
and the current theme."
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents template)
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (if (re-search-forward "$height" nil t)
        (replace-match (number-to-string height) t t)
      (if (re-search-forward "height=\"100\\(?:\\.0[0-9]*\\)?\"" nil t)
          (progn
            (replace-match (format "height=\"%s\"" height) t t)
            (goto-char (point-min))
            (when (re-search-forward "\\([ \t\n]\\)width=\"[\\.0-9]+\"[ \t\n]*" nil t)
              (replace-match "\\1")))
        (warn "Warning! fancy splash template: neither $height nor height=100 not found in %s" template)))
    (dolist (substitution fancy-splash-template-colours)
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (let* ((replacement-colour
              (face-attribute (plist-get (cdr substitution) :face)
                              (or (plist-get (cdr substitution) :attr) :foreground)
                              nil 'default))
             (replacement-hex
              (if (string-prefix-p "#" replacement-colour)
                  replacement-colour
                (apply 'format "#%02x%02x%02x"
                       (mapcar (lambda (c) (ash c -8))
                               (color-values replacement-colour))))))
        (while (search-forward (car substitution) nil t)
          (replace-match replacement-hex nil nil))))
    (unless (file-exists-p fancy-splash-cache-dir)
      (make-directory fancy-splash-cache-dir t))
    (let ((inhibit-message t))
      (write-region nil nil (fancy-splash-filename (car custom-enabled-themes) template height)))))
#+end_src

We may as well generate each theme's appropriate images in bunk.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun fancy-splash-generate-all-images ()
  "Perform `fancy-splash-generate-image' in bulk."
  (dolist (size fancy-splash-sizes)
    (unless (plist-get size :file)
      (fancy-splash-generate-image
       (or (plist-get size :template)
           fancy-splash-image-template)
       (plist-get size :height)))))
#+end_src

It would be nice to have a simple check function which will just generate the
set of relevant images if needed, and do nothing if they already exist.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun fancy-splash-ensure-theme-images-exist (&optional height)
  "Ensure that the relevant images exist.
Use the image of HEIGHT to check, defaulting to the height of the first
specification in `fancy-splash-sizes'. If that file does not exist for
the current theme, `fancy-splash-generate-all-images' is called. "
  (unless (file-exists-p
           (fancy-splash-filename
            (car custom-enabled-themes)
            fancy-splash-image-template
            (or height (plist-get (car fancy-splash-sizes) :height))))
    (fancy-splash-generate-all-images)))
#+end_src

In case we switch out the images used (or something else goes wrong), it would
be good to have a convenient method to clear this cache.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun fancy-splash-clear-cache (&optional delete-files)
  "Clear all cached fancy splash images.
Optionally delete all cache files and regenerate the currently relevant set."
  (interactive (list t))
  (dolist (size fancy-splash-sizes)
    (unless (plist-get size :file)
      (let ((image-file
             (fancy-splash-filename
              (car custom-enabled-themes)
              (or (plist-get size :template)
                  fancy-splash-image-template)
              (plist-get size :height))))
        (image-flush (create-image image-file) t))))
  (message "Fancy splash image cache cleared!")
  (when delete-files
    (delete-directory fancy-splash-cache-dir t)
    (fancy-splash-generate-all-images)
    (message "Fancy splash images cache deleted!")))
#+end_src

In a similar way, it could be fun to allow for switching the template used. We
can support this by looking for files ending in =-template.svg= and running
~image-flush~ via ~fancy-splash-clear-cache~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun fancy-splash-switch-template ()
  "Switch the template used for the fancy splash image."
  (interactive)
  (let ((new (completing-read
              "Splash template: "
              (mapcar
               (lambda (template)
                 (replace-regexp-in-string "-template\\.svg$" "" template))
               (directory-files fancy-splash-image-directory nil "-template\\.svg\\'"))
              nil t)))
    (setq fancy-splash-image-template
          (expand-file-name (concat new "-template.svg") fancy-splash-image-directory))
    (fancy-splash-clear-cache)
    (message "") ; Clear message from `fancy-splash-clear-cache'.
    (setq fancy-splash--last-size nil)
    (fancy-splash-apply-appropriate-image)))
#+end_src

Now we can ensure that the desired images exist, we need to work out which
particular one we want. This is really just a matter of comparing the frame
height to the set of presets.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun fancy-splash-get-appropriate-size ()
  "Find the firt `fancy-splash-sizes' with min-height of at least frame height."
  (let ((height (frame-height)))
    (cl-some (lambda (size) (when (>= height (plist-get size :min-height)) size))
             fancy-splash-sizes)))
#+end_src

We now want to apply the appropriate image to the dashboard. At the same time,
we don't want to do so needlessly, so we may as well record the size and theme
to determine when a refresh is actually needed.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq fancy-splash--last-size nil)
(setq fancy-splash--last-theme nil)

(defun fancy-splash-apply-appropriate-image (&rest _)
  "Ensure the appropriate splash image is applied to the dashboard.
This function's signature is \"&rest _\" to allow it to be used
in hooks that call functions with arguments."
  (let ((appropriate-size (fancy-splash-get-appropriate-size)))
    (unless (and (equal appropriate-size fancy-splash--last-size)
                 (equal (car custom-enabled-themes) fancy-splash--last-theme))
      (unless (plist-get appropriate-size :file)
        (fancy-splash-ensure-theme-images-exist (plist-get appropriate-size :height)))
      (setq fancy-splash-image
            (or (plist-get appropriate-size :file)
                (fancy-splash-filename (car custom-enabled-themes)
                                       fancy-splash-image-template
                                       (plist-get appropriate-size :height)))
            +doom-dashboard-banner-padding (plist-get appropriate-size :padding)
            fancy-splash--last-size appropriate-size
            fancy-splash--last-theme (car custom-enabled-themes))
      (+doom-dashboard-reload))))
#+end_src

**** ASCII banner

If we're operating in a terminal (or =emacclient=) we see an ascii banner instead
of the graphical one. I'd also like to use something simple for this.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun doom-dashboard-draw-ascii-emacs-banner-fn ()
  (let* ((banner
          '(",---.,-.-.,---.,---.,---."
            "|---'| | |,---||    `---."
            "`---'` ' '`---^`---'`---'"))
         (longest-line (apply #'max (mapcar #'length banner))))
    (put-text-property
     (point)
     (dolist (line banner (point))
       (insert (+doom-dashboard--center
                +doom-dashboard--width
                (concat
                 line (make-string (max 0 (- longest-line (length line)))
                                   32)))
               "\n"))
     'face 'doom-dashboard-banner)))
#+end_src

Now we just need this as Doom's ASCII banner function.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(unless (display-graphic-p) ; for some reason this messes up the graphical splash screen atm
  (setq +doom-dashboard-ascii-banner-fn #'doom-dashboard-draw-ascii-emacs-banner-fn))
#+end_src

**** Splash phrases
#+call: confpkg("splash-phrases", prefix="")


Having an aesthetically pleasing image is all very well and good, but I'm aiming
for minimal, not clinical --- it would be good to inject some fun into the
dashboard. After trawling around the internet for a bit, I've found three
sources of fun phrases, namely:
+ a nonsense corporate jargon generator,
+ a selection of random developer excuses, and
+ a collection of fun but rather useless facts.

I used to have a fancy method that used web APIs for these and inserted an
invisible placeholder into the dashboard which was asynchronously replaced on
the result of (debounced) requests to the APIs. While that actually worked quite
well, I realised that it would be much better and simpler if I simply copied the
phrases sources to local files and did the random selection / generation in
elisp.

Let's start off by setting the local folder to put the phrase source files in.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar splash-phrase-source-folder
  (expand-file-name "misc/splash-phrases" doom-user-dir)
  "A folder of text files with a fun phrase on each line.")
#+end_src

Now we want to support two "phrase systems"
1. A complete file of phrases, one phrase per line
2. A collection of phrase-components, put together to form a phrase

It would be good to specify/detect which of the two cases apply based on the
file name alone. I've done this by setting the simple check that if the file
name contains =-N-= (where =N= is some number) then it is taken as the =N=​th phrase
component, with everything preceding the =-N-= token taken as the collection
identifier, and everything after =-N-= ignored.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar splash-phrase-sources
  (let* ((files (directory-files splash-phrase-source-folder nil "\\.txt\\'"))
         (sets (delete-dups (mapcar
                             (lambda (file)
                               (replace-regexp-in-string "\\(?:-[0-9]+-\\w+\\)?\\.txt" "" file))

                    (delq nil (mapcar
                               (lambda (file)
                                 (when (string-match-p (regexp-quote sset) file)
                                   file))
                               files))))
            sets))
  "A list of cons giving the phrase set name, and a list of files which contain phrase components.")
#+end_src

Let's fix the phrase set in use, and pick a random phrase source on startup.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar splash-phrase-set
  (nth (random (length splash-phrase-sources)) (mapcar #'car splash-phrase-sources))
  "The default phrase set. See `splash-phrase-sources'.")
#+end_src

While having a random set of phrases is fantastic the vast majority of the time,
I expect that occasionally I'll feel in the mood to change the phrase set or
pick a particular one, so some functions for that would be nice.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun splash-phrase-set-random-set ()
  "Set a new random splash phrase set."
  (interactive)
  (setq splash-phrase-set
        (nth (random (1- (length splash-phrase-sources)))
             (cl-set-difference (mapcar #'car splash-phrase-sources) (list splash-phrase-set))))
  (+doom-dashboard-reload t))

(defun splash-phrase-select-set ()
  "Select a specific splash phrase set."
  (interactive)
  (setq splash-phrase-set (completing-read "Phrase set: " (mapcar #'car splash-phrase-sources)))
  (+doom-dashboard-reload t))
#+end_src

If we're going to be selecting phrases from a large list of lines, it could be
worth caching the list of lines.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar splash-phrase--cached-lines nil)
#+end_src

Now let's write a function that will pick a random line from a file, using
~splash-phrase--cached-lines~ if possible.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun splash-phrase-get-from-file (file)
  "Fetch a random line from FILE."
  (let ((lines (or (cdr (assoc file splash-phrase--cached-lines))
                   (cdar (push (cons file
                                     (with-temp-buffer
                                       (insert-file-contents (expand-file-name file splash-phrase-source-folder))
                                       (split-string (string-trim (buffer-string)) "\n")))
                               splash-phrase--cached-lines)))))
    (nth (random (length lines)) lines)))
#+end_src

With this, we now have enough to generate random phrases on demand.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun splash-phrase (&optional set)
  "Construct a splash phrase from SET. See `splash-phrase-sources'."
  (mapconcat
   #'splash-phrase-get-from-file
   (cdr (assoc (or set splash-phrase-set) splash-phrase-sources))
   " "))
#+end_src

I originally thought this might be enough, but some phrases are a tad long, and
this isn't exactly doom-dashboard appropriate. In such cases we need to split
lines, re-centre them, and add some whitespace. While we're at it, we may as
well make it that you can click on the phrase to replace it with new one.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun splash-phrase-dashboard-formatted ()
  "Get a splash phrase, flow it over multiple lines as needed, and fontify it."
  (mapconcat
   (lambda (line)
     (+doom-dashboard--center
      +doom-dashboard--width
      (with-temp-buffer
        (insert-text-button
         line
         'action
         (lambda (_) (+doom-dashboard-reload t))
         'face 'doom-dashboard-menu-title
         'mouse-face 'doom-dashboard-menu-title
         'help-echo "Random phrase"
         'follow-link t)
        (buffer-string))))
   (split-string
    (with-temp-buffer
      (insert (splash-phrase))
      (setq fill-column (min 70 (/ (* 2 (window-width)) 3)))
      (fill-region (point-min) (point-max))
      (buffer-string))
    "\n")
   "\n"))
#+end_src

Almost there now, this just needs some centreing and newlines.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun splash-phrase-dashboard-insert ()
  "Insert the splash phrase surrounded by newlines."
  (insert "\n" (splash-phrase-dashboard-formatted) "\n"))
#+end_src

**** Quick actions

When using the dashboard, there are often a small number of actions I will take.
As the dashboard is it's own major mode, there is no need to suffer the tyranny
of unnecessary keystrokes --- we can simply bind common actions to a single key!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +doom-dashboard-setup-modified-keymap ()
  (setq +doom-dashboard-mode-map (make-sparse-keymap))
  (map! :map +doom-dashboard-mode-map
        :desc "Find file" :ng "f" #'find-file
        :desc "Recent files" :ng "r" #'consult-recent-file
        :desc "Config dir" :ng "C" #'doom/open-private-config
        :desc "Open config.org" :ng "c" (cmd! (find-file (expand-file-name "config.org" doom-user-dir)))
        :desc "Open org-mode root" :ng "O" (cmd! (find-file (expand-file-name "lisp/org/" doom-user-dir)))
        :desc "Open dotfile" :ng "." (cmd! (doom-project-find-file "~/.config/"))
        :desc "Notes (roam)" :ng "n" #'org-roam-node-find
        :desc "Switch buffer" :ng "b" #'+vertico/switch-workspace-buffer
        :desc "Switch buffers (all)" :ng "B" #'consult-buffer
        :desc "IBuffer" :ng "i" #'ibuffer
        :desc "Previous buffer" :ng "p" #'previous-buffer
        :desc "Set theme" :ng "t" #'consult-theme
        :desc "Quit" :ng "Q" #'save-buffers-kill-terminal
        :desc "Show keybindings" :ng "h" (cmd! (which-key-show-keymap '+doom-dashboard-mode-map))))

(add-transient-hook! #'+doom-dashboard-mode (+doom-dashboard-setup-modified-keymap))
(add-transient-hook! #'+doom-dashboard-mode :append (+doom-dashboard-setup-modified-keymap))
(add-hook! 'doom-init-ui-hook :append (+doom-dashboard-setup-modified-keymap))
#+end_src

Unfortunately the show keybindings help doesn't currently work as intended, but
this is still quite nice overall.

Now that the dashboard is so convenient, I'll want to make it easier to get to.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :leader :desc "Dashboard" "d" #'+doom-dashboard/open)
#+end_src

**** Putting it all together

With the splash image and phrase generation worked out, we can almost put
together the desired dashboard from scratch, we just need to re-create the
benchmark information by itself.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +doom-dashboard-benchmark-line ()
  "Insert the load time line."
  (when doom-init-time
    (insert
     "\n\n"
     (propertize
      (+doom-dashboard--center
       +doom-dashboard--width
       (doom-display-benchmark-h 'return))
      'face 'doom-dashboard-loaded))))
#+end_src

With ~doom-display-benchmark-h~ displayed here, I don't see the need for it to be
shown in the minibuffer as well.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(remove-hook 'doom-after-init-hook #'doom-display-benchmark-h)
#+end_src

Now we can create the desired dashboard by setting ~+doom-dashboard-functions~ to
just have:
+ The "widget banner" (splash image)
+ The benchmark line
+ A random phrase
This gets rid of two segments I'm not particularly interested in seeing
+ The shortmenu
+ The footer (github link)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq +doom-dashboard-functions
      (list #'doom-dashboard-widget-banner
            #'+doom-dashboard-benchmark-line
            #'splash-phrase-dashboard-insert))
#+end_src

At this point there are just a few minor tweaks I'd still like to make to the
dashboard.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +doom-dashboard-tweak (&optional _)
  (with-current-buffer (get-buffer +doom-dashboard-name)
    (setq-local line-spacing 0.2
                mode-line-format nil
                evil-normal-state-cursor (list nil))))
#+end_src

Now we can just add this as a mode hook.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook '+doom-dashboard-mode-hook #'+doom-dashboard-tweak)
#+end_src

Unfortunately, the initialisation of =doom-modeline= interferes with the set
~mode-line-format~ value. To get around this, we can re-apply
~+doom-dashboard-tweak~ as a slightly late init hook, after =doom-modeline= has been
loaded.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'doom-after-init-hook #'+doom-dashboard-tweak 1)
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq +doom-dashboard-name "► Doom"
      doom-fallback-buffer-name +doom-dashboard-name)
#+end_src

The end result is a minimal but rather nice splash screen.

To keep the splash image up to date, we just need to check it every time the
frame size or theme is changed.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'window-size-change-functions #'fancy-splash-apply-appropriate-image)
(add-hook 'doom-load-theme-hook #'fancy-splash-apply-appropriate-image)
#+end_src

*** Grabbing source block content as a string

In a few places in this configuration, it is desirable to grab a source block's
content as a string. We can use a noweb =<<replacement>>= form, however that
doesn't work with string escaping.

We can get around this by using noweb execution and write an name (unexported)
babel block that will grab the content of another named source block as a
string. Note that this does not currently expand nested noweb references.

#+name: grab
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :var name="" :noweb-ref none
(if-let ((block-pos (org-babel-find-named-block name))
         (block (org-element-at-point block-pos)))
    (format "%S" (string-trim (org-element-property :value block)))
  ;; look for :noweb-ref matches
  (let (block-contents)
    (org-element-cache-map
     (lambda (src)
       (when (and (not (org-in-commented-heading-p nil src))
                  (not (org-in-archived-heading-p nil src))
                  (let* ((lang (org-element-property :language src))
                         (params
                          (apply
                           #'org-babel-merge-params
                           (append
                            (org-with-point-at (org-element-property :begin src)
                              (org-babel-params-from-properties lang t))
                            (mapcar
                             (lambda (h)
                               (org-babel-parse-header-arguments h t))
                             (cons (org-element-property :parameters src)
                                   (org-element-property :header src))))))
                         (ref (alist-get :noweb-ref params)))
                    (equal ref name)))
         (push (org-babel--normalize-body src)
               block-contents)))
     :granularity 'element
     :restrict-elements '(src-block))
    (and block-contents
         (format "%S"
                 (mapconcat
                  #'identity
                  (nreverse block-contents)
                  "\n\n")))))
#+end_src

There we go, that's all it takes! This can be used via the form =<<grab("block-name")>>=.

**** void-packages
I'm using [[https:voidlinux.org][Void Linux]], a Linux distribution with a minimal init system and a very
interesting package manager.
The base of the package manager, the packages, are defined [[github:void-linux/void-packages][in a git repo]]. So
called ~srcpkgs~ are built using a ~template~ file. It even allows for ~patches~
to be applied on the ~sourcecode~.

Anyways, the ~template~ files are basically ~sh~-files with special functions to
be implemented/overwritten. So I'd like to recognize them and activate
~sh~-mode.

My idea is to hook the ~projectile-after-switch-project-hook~ to check if the
~projectile-project-name~ equals ~"void-packages"~ and add ~sh-mode~ for
~"template"~ files. But the hook triggers just /after/ the first selected buffer
is open. If that first buffer is a template file, the ~sh-mode~ isn't activated.
Simple fix: revert the buffer opened to retrigger emacs choosing the major mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun conditional-sh-mode-on-template-files ()
  "activate sh-mode for template files"
  (when (string-equal (projectile-project-name) "void-packages")
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("template" . sh-mode))

**** Configuration

Oh, and by the way, if ~company-ispell-dictionary~ is ~nil~, then
~ispell-complete-word-dict~ is used instead, which once again when ~nil~ is
~ispell-alternate-dictionary~, which at the moment maps to a plaintext version of
the above.

It seems reasonable to want to keep an eye on my personal dict, let's have it
nearby (also means that if I change the 'main' dictionary I keep my addition).

*** TRAMP

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg TRAMP")

Another lovely Emacs feature, TRAMP stands for /Transparent Remote Access,
Multiple Protocol/. In brief, it's a lovely way to wander around outside your
local filesystem.

**** Prompt recognition

Unfortunately, when connecting to remote machines Tramp can be a wee pit picky
with the prompt format. Let's try to get Bash, and be a bit more permissive with
prompt recognition.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! tramp
  (setenv "SHELL" "/bin/bash")
  (setq tramp-shell-prompt-pattern "\\(?:^\\|\n\\|\x0d\\)[^]#$%>\n]*#?[]#$%>] *\\(\e\\[[0-9;]*[a-zA-Z] *\\)*")) ;; default + 

To use this we'll just hook it into =Info=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Emojify


#+call: confpkg("!Pkg emojify")
#+begin_quote
From the =:ui emoji= module.
#+end_quote


For starters, twitter's emojis look nicer than emoji-one.
Other than that, this is pretty great OOTB 😀.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq emojify-emoji-set "twemoji-v2")
#+end_src

One minor annoyance is the use of emojis over the default character
when the default is actually preferred. This occurs with overlay symbols I use
in Org mode, such as checkbox state, and a few other miscellaneous cases.

We can accommodate our preferences by deleting those entries from the emoji hash
table

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar emojify-disabled-emojis
  '(;; Org
    "◼" "☑" "☸" "⚙" "⏩" "⏪" "⬆" "⬇" "❓" "↔"
    ;; Terminal powerline
    "✔"
    ;; Box drawing
    "▶" "◀"
    ;; I just want to see this as text
    "©" "™")
  "Characters that should never be affected by `emojify-mode'.")

(defadvice! emojify-delete-from-data ()
  "Ensure `emojify-disabled-emojis' don't appear in `emojify-emojis'."

#+end_src


*** Doom modeline

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg Doom modeline", after="doom-modeline")

#+begin_quote
From the =:ui modeline= module.
#+end_quote

**** Modified buffer colour


By default, ~red~ text is used to indicate an unsaved file. But, in software
development, red ususally means error. Let's tone that down to
orange.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(doom-modeline-buffer-modified :foreground "orange"))
#+end_src

**** Height

The default size (=25=) makes for a rather narrow mode line. To me, the modeline
feels a bit comfier if we give it a bit more space. I find =45= adds roughly a
third of the line height as padding above and below.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-modeline-height 35)
#+end_src

**** File encoding

Only display fileencoding in modeline whenever we don't have ~utf-8~ files.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding ()
  "We expect the encoding to be LF UTF-8, so only show the modeline when this is not the case"
  (setq-local doom-modeline-buffer-encoding
              (unless (and (memq (plist-get (coding-system-plist buffer-file-coding-system) :category)
                                 '(coding-category-undecided coding-category-utf-8))
                           (not (memq (coding-system-eol-type buffer-file-coding-system) '(1 2))))
                t)))

(add-hook 'after-change-major-mode-hook #'doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding)
#+end_src

*** Mixed pitch


#+call: confpkg("!Pkg mixed pitch")
#+begin_quote
From the =:ui zen= module.
#+end_quote

We'd like to use mixed pitch in certain modes. If we simply add a hook, when
directly opening a file with (a new) Emacs =mixed-pitch-mode= runs before UI
initialisation, which is problematic. To resolve this, we create a hook that
runs after UI initialisation and both
+ conditionally enables =mixed-pitch-mode=
+ sets up the mixed pitch hooks

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar mixed-pitch-modes '(org-mode LaTeX-mode markdown-mode gfm-mode Info-mode)
  "Modes that `mixed-pitch-mode' should be enabled in, but only after UI initialisation.")
(defun init-mixed-pitch-h ()
  "Hook `mixed-pitch-mode' into each mode in `mixed-pitch-modes'.
Also immediately enables `mixed-pitch-modes' if currently in one of the modes."
  (when (memq major-mode mixed-pitch-modes)
    (mixed-pitch-mode 1))
  (dolist (hook mixed-pitch-modes)
    (add-hook (intern (concat (symbol-name hook) "-hook")) #'mixed-pitch-mode)))
(add-hook 'doom-init-ui-hook #'init-mixed-pitch-h)
#+end_src

As mixed pitch uses the variable =mixed-pitch-face=, we can create a new function
to apply mixed pitch with a serif face instead of the default (see the
subsequent face definition). This was created for writeroom mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(autoload #'mixed-pitch-serif-mode "mixed-pitch"
  "Change the default face of the current buffer to a serifed variable pitch, while keeping some faces fixed pitch." t)

(setq! variable-pitch-serif-font (font-spec :family "Alegreya" :size 27))

(after! mixed-pitch
  (setq mixed-pitch-set-height t)
  (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch-serif nil :font variable-pitch-serif-font)
  (defun mixed-pitch-serif-mode (&optional arg)
    "Change the default face of the current buffer to a serifed variable pitch, while keeping some faces fixed pitch."
    (interactive)
    (let ((mixed-pitch-face 'variable-pitch-serif))
      (mixed-pitch-mode (or arg 'toggle)))))
#+end_src

Now, as Harfbuzz is currently used in Emacs, we'll be missing out on the
following Alegreya ligatures:
#+begin_center
ff /ff/ ffi /ffi/ ffj /ffj/ ffl /ffl/
fft /fft/ fi /fi/ fj /fj/ ft /ft/
Th /Th/
#+end_center

Thankfully, it isn't to hard to add these to the ~composition-function-table~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-char-table-range composition-function-table ?f '(["\\(?:ff?[fijlt]\\)" 0 font-shape-gstring]))
(set-char-table-range composition-function-table ?T '(["\\(?:Th\\)" 0 font-shape-gstring]))
#+end_src

**** Variable pitch serif font


#+call: confpkg()
It would be nice if we were able to make use of a serif version of the
=variable-pitch= face. Since this doesn't already exist, let's create it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defface variable-pitch-serif
    '((t (:family "serif")))
    "A variable-pitch face with serifs."
    :group 'basic-faces)
#+end_src

For ease of use, let's also set up an easy way of setting the ~:font~ attribute.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defcustom variable-pitch-serif-font (font-spec :family "serif")
  "The font face used for `variable-pitch-serif'."
  :group 'basic-faces
  :set (lambda (symbol value)
         (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch-serif nil :font value)
         (set-default-toplevel-value symbol value)))
#+end_src

*** Marginalia


#+call: confpkg("!Pkg Marginalia")
#+begin_quote
Part of the =:completion vertico= module.
#+end_quote

Marginalia is nice, but the file metadata annotations are a little too plain.
Specifically, I have these gripes
+ File attributes would be nicer if coloured
+ I don't care about the user/group information if the user/group is me
+ When a file time is recent, a relative age (e.g. =2h ago=) is more useful than
  the date
+ An indication of file fatness would be nice

Thanks to the ~marginalia-annotator-registry~, we don't have to advise, we can
just add a new =file= annotator.

Another small thing is the face used for docstrings. At the moment it's =(italic
shadow)=, but I don't like that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

Beyond the elegance in the markup language, tremendously rich integrations with
Emacs allow for some fantastic [[https://orgmode.org/features.html][features]], such as what seems to be the best
support for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] of any currently available technology.

An =.org= file can contain blocks of code (with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noweb][noweb]] templating support), which
can be [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html][tangled]] to dedicated source code files, and [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html][woven]] into a document
(report, documentation, presentation, etc.) through various (/extensible/) methods.
These source blocks may even create images or other content to be included in
the document, or generate source code.

*** System config
**** Mime types

Org mode isn't recognised as it's own mime type by default, but that can easily
be changed with the following file. For system-wide changes try
~/usr/share/mime/packages/org.xml~.
#+begin_src xml :tangle ~/.local/share/mime/packages/org.xml :mkdirp yes :comments no
<mime-info xmlns='http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info'>
  <mime-type type="text/org">
    <comment>Emacs Org-mode File</comment>
    <glob pattern="*.org"/>
    <alias type="text/org"/>
  </mime-type>
</mime-info>
#+end_src
What's nice is that Papirus [[https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/commit/a10fb7f2423d5e30b9c4477416ccdc93c4f3849d][now]] has an icon for =text/org=.
One simply needs to refresh their mime database
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= (shell-command-to-string "xdg-mime query default text/org") "") "setup.sh" "no")
update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime
#+end_src
Then set Emacs as the default editor
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= (shell-command-to-string "xdg-mime query default text/org") "emacs-client.desktop\n") "no" "setup.sh")
xdg-mime default emacs.desktop text/org

By default, ~visual-line-mode~ is turned =on=, and ~auto-fill-mode~ =off= by a hook.

***** Citation

#+call: confpkg("Org Citation")

Extending the =:tools biblio= module.
#+end_quote

References in Org are fairly easy now, thanks to =org-cite=. The =:tools biblio=
module gives a fairly decent basic setup, but it would be nice to take it a bit
further. This mostly consists of tweaking settings, but there is one extra
package I'll grab for prettier in-buffer citations.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! org-cite-csl-activate :recipe (:host github :repo "andras-simonyi/org-cite-csl-activate") :pin "9e68d9204469c674f49a20bdf7ea85da4f4bf720")
#+end_src

In particular, by setting ~org-cite-csl-activate-use-document-style~, we can have
the in-buffer displayed citations be the same as the exported form. Isn't that lovely!

Unfortunately, there's currently a potential for undesirable buffer
modifications, so we'll put all the activation code behind a function we can
call when we want it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! oc-csl-activate
  :after oc
  :config
  (setq org-cite-csl-activate-use-document-style t)
  (defun +org-cite-csl-activate/enable ()
    (interactive)
    (setq org-cite-activate-processor 'csl-activate)
    (add-hook! 'org-mode-hook '((lambda () (cursor-sensor-mode 1)) org-cite-csl-activate-render-all))
    (defadvice! +org-cite-csl-activate-render-all-silent (orig-fn)
      :around #'org-cite-csl-activate-render-all
      (with-silent-modifications (funcall orig-fn)))
    (when (eq major-mode 'org-mode)
      (with-silent-modifications
        (save-excursion
          (goto-char (point-min))
          (org-cite-activate (point-max)))
        (org-cite-csl-activate-render-all)))
    (fmakunbound #'+org-cite-csl-activate/enable)))
#+end_src

Now that =oc-csl-activate= is set up, let's go ahead and customise some of the
packages already loaded. For starters, we can make use of the my Zotero files
with =citar=, and make the symbols a bit prettier.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! citar
  (setq org-cite-global-bibliography
        (let ((libfile-search-names '("library.json" "Library.json" "library.bib" "Library.bib"))
              (libfile-dir "~/Zotero")
              paths)
          (dolist (libfile libfile-search-names)
            (when (and (not paths)
                       (file-exists-p (expand-file-name libfile libfile-dir)))
              (setq paths (list (expand-file-name libfile libfile-dir)))))
          paths)
        citar-bibliography org-cite-global-bibliography
        citar-symbols
        `((file ,(all-the-icons-faicon "file-o" :face 'all-the-icons-green :v-adjust -0.1) . " ")
          (note ,(all-the-icons-material "speaker_notes" :face 'all-the-icons-blue :v-adjust -0.3) . " ")
          (link ,(all-the-icons-octicon "link" :face 'all-the-icons-orange :v-adjust 0.01) . " "))))
#+end_src

We can also make the Zotero CSL styles available to use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! oc-csl
  (setq org-cite-csl-styles-dir "~/Zotero/styles"))
#+end_src

Since CSL works so nicely everywhere, we might as well use it as the default
citation export processor for everything.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! oc
  (setq org-cite-export-processors '((t csl))))
#+end_src

Then, for convenience we'll cap things off by putting the citation command under
Org's localleader.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :after org
      :map org-mode-map
      :localleader
      :desc "Insert citation" "@" #'org-cite-insert)
#+end_src

Lastly, just in case I come across any old citations of mine, I think it would
be nice to have a function to convert =org-ref= citations to =org-cite= forms.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! oc
  (defun org-ref-to-org-cite ()
    "Attempt to convert org-ref citations to org-cite syntax."
    (interactive)
    (let* ((cite-conversions '(("cite" . "//b") ("Cite" . "//bc")

                               ("pnotecite" . "/l") ("Pnotecite" . "/l/bc")))
           (cite-regexp (rx (regexp (regexp-opt (mapcar #'car cite-conversions) t))
                            ":" (group (+ (not (any "\n 	,.)]}")))))))
      (save-excursion
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (while (re-search-forward cite-regexp nil t)
          (message (format "[cite%s:@%s]"
                                 (cdr (assoc (match-string 1) cite-conversions))

          (replace-match (format "[cite%s:@%s]"
                                 (cdr (assoc (match-string 1) cite-conversions))

***** cdlatex

**** Nicer generated heading IDs

Thanks to alphapapa's [[https://github.com/alphapapa/unpackaged.el#export-to-html-with-useful-anchors][unpackaged.el]].

By default, Org generated heading IDs like =#org80fc2a5= which ... works, but has
two issues
+ It's completely uninformative, I have no idea what's being referenced
+ If I export the same file, everything will change.
  Now, while without hardcoded values it's impossible to set references in
  stone, it would be nice for there to be a decent chance of staying the same.

Both of these issues can be addressed by generating IDs like
=#language-configuration=, which is what I'll do here.

It's worth noting that alphapapa's use of ~url-hexify-string~ seemed to cause me
some issues. Replacing that in ~a53899~ resolved this for me. To go one step
further, I create a function for producing nice short links, like an inferior
version of ~reftex-label~.

#+call: confpkg("Org Visuals", after="org")

Here I try to do two things: improve the styling of the various documents, via
font changes etc, and also propagate colours from the current theme.

[[xkcd:1882]]

**** Inline Images

I like displaying inline images since it works for [[xkcd]] as well!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'(lambda () (org-display-inline-images)))
#+end_src

**** Font Display

Mixed pitch is great. As is ~+org-pretty-mode~, let's use them.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'+org-pretty-mode)
#+end_src

Let's make headings a bit bigger
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(outline-1 :weight extra-bold :height 1.25)
  '(outline-2 :weight bold :height 1.15)
  '(outline-3 :weight bold :height 1.12)
  '(outline-4 :weight semi-bold :height 1.09)
  '(outline-5 :weight semi-bold :height 1.06)
  '(outline-6 :weight semi-bold :height 1.03)
  '(outline-8 :weight semi-bold)
  '(outline-9 :weight semi-bold))
#+end_src

And the same with the title.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(org-document-title :height 1.2))
#+end_src

It seems reasonable to have deadlines in the error face when they're passed.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-deadline-faces
      '((1.001 . error)
        (1.0 . org-warning)
        (0.5 . org-upcoming-deadline)
        (0.0 . org-upcoming-distant-deadline)))
#+end_src

We can then have quote blocks stand out a bit more by making them /italic/.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-fontify-quote-and-verse-blocks t)
#+end_src

Org files can be rather nice to look at, particularly with some of the
customisations here. This comes at a cost however, expensive font-lock.
Feeling like you're typing through molasses in large files is no fun, but there
is a way I can defer font-locking when typing to make the experience more
responsive.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun locally-defer-font-lock ()
  "Set jit-lock defer and stealth, when buffer is over a certain size."
  (when (> (buffer-size) 50000)
    (setq-local jit-lock-defer-time 0.05
                jit-lock-stealth-time 1)))

(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'locally-defer-font-lock)
#+end_src
Apparently this causes issues with some people, but I haven't noticed anything
problematic beyond the expected slight delay in some fontification, so until I
do I'll use the above.

**** Reduced text indent

Thanks to the various bits and bobs of setup we have here, the non-heading lines
tend to appear over-indented in ~org-indent-mode~. We can adjust this by modifying
the generated text prefixes.

There's another issue we can have when using mixed-pitch mode, where the line
height is set by the indent prefix displayed with the fixed-pitch font. This
means that on 0-indent lines the line spacing can be different, which doesn't
look very good. We can also solve this problem by modifying the generated text
prefixes to but a fixed-pitch zero width space at the start of 0-indent lines
instead of nothing.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! +org-indent--reduced-text-prefixes ()
  :after #'org-indent--compute-prefixes
  (setq org-indent--text-line-prefixes
        (make-vector org-indent--deepest-level nil))
  (when (> org-indent-indentation-per-level 0)
    (dotimes (n org-indent--deepest-level)
      (aset org-indent--text-line-prefixes
            n
            (org-add-props
                (concat (make-string (* n (1- org-indent-indentation-per-level))
                                     ?\s)
                        (if (> n 0)
                             (char-to-string org-indent-boundary-char)
                          "\u200b"))
                nil 'face 'org-indent)))))
#+end_src

**** Fontifying inline src blocks

Org does lovely things with =#+begin_src= blocks, like using font-lock for
language's major-mode behind the scenes and pulling out the lovely colourful
results. By contrast, inline =src_= blocks are somewhat neglected.

I am not the first person to feel this way, thankfully others have [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20309842/how-to-syntax-highlight-for-org-mode-inline-source-code-src-lang/28059832][taken to
stackexchange]] to voice their desire for inline src fontification. I was going to
steal their work, but unfortunately they didn't perform /true/ source code
fontification, but simply applied the =org-code= face to the content.

We can do better than that, and we shall! Using ~org-src-font-lock-fontify-block~
we can apply language-appropriate syntax highlighting. Then, continuing on to
={{{results(...)}}}= , it can have the =org-block= face applied to match, and then
the value-surrounding constructs hidden by mimicking the behaviour of
~prettify-symbols-mode~.

#+begin_warning
This currently only highlights a single inline src block per line.
I have no idea why it stops, but I'd rather it didn't.
If you have any idea what's going on or how to fix this /please/ get in touch.
#+end_warning

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-inline-src-prettify-results '("⟨" . "⟩"))
#+end_src

Doom theme's extra fontification is more problematic than helpful.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-themes-org-fontify-special-tags nil)
#+end_src

**** Symbols

It's also nice to change the character used for collapsed items (by default ~…~),
I think ~▾~ is better for indicating 'collapsed section'.
and add an extra ~org-bullet~ to the default list of four.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-ellipsis " ▾ "
      org-hide-leading-stars t
      org-priority-highest ?A
      org-priority-lowest ?E
      org-priority-faces
      '((?A . 'all-the-icons-red)
        (?B . 'all-the-icons-orange)
        (?C . 'all-the-icons-yellow)
        (?D . 'all-the-icons-green)
        (?E . 'all-the-icons-blue)))
#+end_src

It's also nice to make use of the =prettify-symbols-mode= for a few Org syntactic
tokens which we'd like to prettify that aren't covered by =org-modern= or any
other settings.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(appendq! +ligatures-extra-symbols
          (list :list_property "∷"
                :em_dash       "—"
                :ellipses      "…"
                :arrow_right   "→"
                :arrow_left    "←"
                :arrow_lr      "↔"
                :properties    "⚙"
                :end           "∎"
                :priority_a    #("⚑" 0 1 (face all-the-icons-red))
                :priority_b    #("⬆" 0 1 (face all-the-icons-orange))
                :priority_c    #("■" 0 1 (face all-the-icons-yellow))
                :priority_d    #("⬇" 0 1 (face all-the-icons-green))
                :priority_e    #("❓" 0 1 (face all-the-icons-blue))))

(defadvice! +org-init-appearance-h--no-ligatures-a ()

  (set-ligatures! 'org-mode nil)
  (set-ligatures! 'org-mode

    :priority_d    "[#D]"
    :priority_e    "[#E]"))
#+end_src

**** LaTeX Fragments
***** Prettier highlighting

First off, we want those fragments to look good.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-highlight-latex-and-related '(native script entities))
#+end_src

However, by using =native= highlighting the =org-block= face is added, and that
doesn't look too great --- particularly when the fragments are previewed.

Ideally ~org-src-font-lock-fontify-block~ wouldn't add the =org-block= face, but we
can avoid advising that entire function by just adding another face with
=:inherit default= which will override the background colour.

Inspecting ~org-do-latex-and-related~ shows that ="latex"= is the language argument
passed, and so we can override the background as discussed above.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-src)
(add-to-list 'org-src-block-faces '("latex" (:inherit default :extend t)))
#+end_src

***** Automatic previewing

It would be nice if fragments could automatically be previewed after being
typed, and the overlays automatically showed and hidden when moving the point in
and out of the LaTeX fragments.

Thankfully, all we need to do to make this happen is use ~org-latex-preview-auto-mode~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'org-latex-preview-auto-mode)
#+end_src

***** Prettier rendering

It's nice to customise the look of LaTeX fragments so they fit better in the
text --- like this \(\sqrt{\beta^2+3}-\sum_{\phi=1}^\infty \frac{x^\phi-1}{\Gamma(a)}\).

The default snippet preamble basically just sets the margins and text size, with
templates to be filled in by ~org-latex-default-packages-alist~ and
=#+latex_header:= entries (but not =#+latex_header_extra:=).

#+name: latex-default-snippet-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\documentclass{article}
[DEFAULT-PACKAGES]
[PACKAGES]
\usepackage{xcolor}
#+end_src

To this, we make two additions:
+ Selection of a maths font that fits better with displayed text.
+ My collection [[*Maths notation conveniences][mathematical notation conveniences]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export :noweb-prefix no
(setq org-latex-preview-header
      (concat
       <<grab("latex-default-snippet-preamble")>>
       "\n% Custom font\n\\usepackage{arev}\n\n"
       <<grab("latex-maths-conveniences")>>))
#+end_src

Since we can, instead of making the background colour match the =default= face,
let's make it transparent.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(plist-put org-format-latex-options :background "Transparent")
(plist-put org-format-latex-options :zoom 0.93) ; Calibrated based on the TeX font and org-buffer font.
#+end_src

With the background taken care of, we just need to make sure we're using the
theme-appropriate foreground.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +org-refresh-latex-images-previews-h ()
  (dolist (buffer (doom-buffers-in-mode 'org-mode (buffer-list)))
    (with-current-buffer buffer
      (+org--toggle-inline-images-in-subtree (point-min) (point-max) 'refresh)
      (unless (eq org-latex-preview-default-process 'dvisvgm)
        (org-clear-latex-preview (point-min) (point-max))
        (org--latex-preview-region (point-min) (point-max))))))

(add-hook 'doom-load-theme-hook #'+org-refresh-latex-images-previews-h)
#+end_src


**** Org Plot

We can use some of the variables in =org-plot= to use the current doom theme
colours.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar +org-plot-term-size '(1050 . 650)

*** Exporting

#+call: confpkg("Org exports", after="ox")

**** General settings

By default Org only exports the first three levels of headings as ... headings.
This is rather unfortunate as my documents frequently stray far beyond three
levels of depth. The two main formats I care about exporting to are LaTeX and
HTML. When using an =article= class, LaTeX headlines go from =\section=,
=\subsection=, =\subsubsection=, and =\paragraph= to =\subgraph= --- /five/ levels.
HTML5 has six levels of headings (=<h1>= to =<h6>=), but first level Org headings
get exported as =<h2>= elements --- leaving /five/ usable levels.

As such, it would seem to make sense to recognise the first /five/ levels of Org
headings when exporting.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-export-headline-levels 5) ; I like nesting
#+end_src

I'm also going to make use of an item in =ox-extra= so that I can add an =:ignore:=
tag to headings for the content to be kept, but the heading itself ignored
(unlike =:noexport:= which ignored both heading and content). This is useful when
I want to use headings to provide a structure for writing that doesn't appear in
the final documents.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'ox-extra)
(ox-extras-activate '(ignore-headlines))
#+end_src

Since I (roughly) track Org ~HEAD~, it makes sense to include the git version in
the creator string.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-export-creator-string
      (format "Emacs %s (Org mode %s–%s)" emacs-version (org-release) (org-git-version)))
#+end_src

**** Acronym formatting

I like automatically using spaced small caps for acronyms. For strings I want to
be unaffected let's use ~;~ as a prefix to prevent the transformation --- i.e.
~;JFK~ (as one would want for two-letter geographic locations and names).

This has to be implemented on a per-format basis, currently HTML and LaTeX
exports are supported.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-export-filter-text-acronym (text backend _info)
  "Wrap suspected acronyms in acronyms-specific formatting.
Treat sequences of 2+ capital letters (optionally succeeded by \"s\") as an acronym.
Ignore if preceeded by \";\" (for manual prevention) or \"\\\" (for LaTeX commands).

TODO abstract backend implementations."
  (let ((base-backend
         (cond
          ((org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'latex) 'latex)
          ;; Markdown is derived from HTML, but we don't want to format it
          ((org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'md) nil)

    (when base-backend
      (replace-regexp-in-string
       "[;\\\\]?\\b[A-Z][A-Z]+s?\\(?:[^A-Za-z]\\|\\b\\)"
       (lambda (all-caps-str)
         (cond ((equal (aref all-caps-str 0) ?\\) all-caps-str)                ; don't format LaTeX commands
               ((equal (aref all-caps-str 0) ?\;) (substring all-caps-str 1))  ; just remove not-acronym indicator char ";"
               (t (let* ((final-char (if (string-match-p "[^A-Za-z]" (substring all-caps-str -1 (length all-caps-str)))
                                         (substring all-caps-str -1 (length all-caps-str))
                                       nil)) ; needed to re-insert the [^A-Za-z] at the end
                         (trailing-s (equal (aref all-caps-str (- (length all-caps-str) (if final-char 2 1))) ?s))
                         (acr (if final-char
                                  (substring all-caps-str 0 (if trailing-s -2 -1))
                                (substring all-caps-str 0 (+ (if trailing-s -1 (length all-caps-str)))))))
                    (pcase base-backend
                      ('latex (concat "\\acr{" (s-downcase acr) "}" (when trailing-s "\\acrs{}") final-char))
                      ('html (concat "<span class='acr'>" acr "</span>" (when trailing-s "<small>s</small>") final-char)))))))
       text t t))))

#+end_src

**** Exporting Org code

With all our Org config and hooks, exporting an Org code block when using
a font-lock based method can produce undesirable results. To address this, we
can tweak ~+org-babel-mode-alist~ when exporting.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +org-mode--fontlock-only-mode ()
  "Just apply org-mode's font-lock once."
  (let (org-mode-hook
        org-hide-leading-stars
        org-hide-emphasis-markers)
    (org-set-font-lock-defaults)
    (font-lock-ensure))
  (setq-local major-mode #'fundamental-mode))

(defun +org-export-babel-mask-org-config (_backend)
  "Use `+org-mode--fontlock-only-mode' instead of `org-mode'."
  (setq-local org-src-lang-modes
              (append org-src-lang-modes
                      (list (cons "org" #'+org-mode--fontlock-only)))))

(add-hook 'org-export-before-processing-hook #'+org-export-babel-mask-org-config)
#+end_src

*** LaTeX Export

#+call: confpkg("ox-latex", after="ox-latex")

**** Compiling

By default Org uses ~pdflatex~ \times 3 + ~bibtex~. This simply won't do in our
modern world. ~latexmk~ + ~biber~ (which is used automatically with ~latexmk~) is a
simply superior combination.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; org-latex-compilers = ("pdflatex" "xelatex" "lualatex"), which are the possible values for %latex
(setq org-latex-pdf-process '("LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 latexmk -f -pdf -%latex -shell-escape -interaction=nonstopmode -output-directory=%o %f"))
#+end_src

While ~org-latex-pdf-process~ does support a function, and we could use that
instead, this would no longer use the log buffer --- it's a bit blind, you give
it the file name and expect it to do its thing.

The default values of ~org-latex-compilers~ is given in commented form to see how
~org-latex-pdf-process~ works with them.

While the ~-%latex~ above is slightly hacky (~-pdflatex~ expects to be given a
value) it allows us to leave ~org-latex-compilers~ unmodified.
This is nice in case I open an org file that uses =#+LATEX_COMPILER= for example,
it should still work.

**** Nicer checkboxes

We'll assume that thanks to the clever preamble the various custom =\checkbox...=
commands below are defined.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +org-export-latex-fancy-item-checkboxes (text backend info)
  (when (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'latex)
    (replace-regexp-in-string
     "\\\\item\\[{$\\\\\\(\\w+\\)$}\\]"
     (lambda (fullmatch)
       (concat "\\\\item[" (pcase (substring fullmatch 9 -3) ; content of capture group
                             ("square"   "\\\\checkboxUnchecked")
                             ("boxminus" "\\\\checkboxTransitive")
                             ("boxtimes" "\\\\checkboxChecked")
                             (_ (substring fullmatch 9 -3))) "]"))
     text)))

(add-to-list 'org-export-filter-item-functions
             '+org-export-latex-fancy-item-checkboxes)
#+end_src

**** Class templates

I really like the KOMA bundle. It provides a set of mechanisms to tweak document
styling which is both easy to use, and quite comprehensive.
For example, I rather like section numbers in the margin, which can be
accomplished with
#+name: latex-hanging-secnum
#+begin_src LaTeX
\renewcommand\sectionformat{\llap{\thesection\autodot\enskip}}
\renewcommand\subsectionformat{\llap{\thesubsection\autodot\enskip}}
\renewcommand\subsubsectionformat{\llap{\thesubsubsection\autodot\enskip}}
#+end_src

Now let's just sprinkle some KOMA all over the Org LaTeX classes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export :noweb-prefix no
(after! ox-latex
  (let* ((article-sections '(("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")
                             ("\\subsection{%s}" . "\\subsection*{%s}")
                             ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                             ("\\paragraph{%s}" . "\\paragraph*{%s}")
                             ("\\subparagraph{%s}" . "\\subparagraph*{%s}")))
         (book-sections (append '(("\\chapter{%s}" . "\\chapter*{%s}"))
                                article-sections))
         (hanging-secnum-preamble <<grab("latex-hanging-secnum")>>))
    (setcdr (assoc "article" org-latex-classes)
            `(,(concat "\\documentclass{scrartcl}" hanging-secnum-preamble)

    (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes
                 `("book" ,(concat "\\documentclass[twoside=false]{scrbook}"
                                   hanging-secnum-preamble)

    (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes
                 `("blank" "[NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES]\n[NO-PACKAGES]\n[EXTRA]"
                   ,@article-sections))

    (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes
                 `("bmc" "\\documentclass[code,maths]{bmc}\n[NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES]\n[NO-PACKAGES]\n[EXTRA]"
                   ,@book-sections))))

(setq org-latex-tables-booktabs t
      org-latex-hyperref-template
      <<grab("latex-fancy-hyperref")>>

The =hyperref= setup needs to be handled separately however.
#+name: latex-fancy-hyperref

#+end_src

**** A cleverer preamble
***** Use case

We often want particular snippets of LaTeX in our documents preambles.
It's a pain to have to work out / remember them every time.
For example, I almost always want to include the snippet below.

#+name: org-latex-embed-files-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\usepackage[main,include]{embedall}
\IfFileExists{./\jobname.org}{\embedfile[desc=The original file]{\jobname.org}}{}
#+end_src

We could have every package we could possibly need in every one of
~org-latex-classes~, but that's /horribly/ inefficient and I don't want to think
about maintaining that.

Instead we can provide some granularity by splitting up the features we want,
and then take the experience to a whole new level by implementing a system to
automatically detect which features are desired and generating a preamble that
provides these features.

***** Conditional Content

Let's consider content we want in particular situations.

Captions could do with a bit of tweaking such that
+ You can easily have multiple captions
+ Links to figures take you to the /top/ of the figure (not the bottom)
+ Caption labels could do with being emphasised slightly more
+ Multiline captions should run ragged-right, but only when then span more than
  one line

#+name: org-latex-caption-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\usepackage{subcaption}
\usepackage[hypcap=true]{caption}
\setkomafont{caption}{\sffamily\small}
\setkomafont{captionlabel}{\upshape\bfseries}
\captionsetup{justification=raggedright,singlelinecheck=true}
\usepackage{capt-of} % required by Org
#+end_src

The default checkboxes look rather ugly, so let's provide some prettier alternatives.

#+name: org-latex-checkbox-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\newcommand{\checkboxUnchecked}{$\square$}
\newcommand{\checkboxTransitive}{\rlap{\raisebox{-0.1ex}{\hspace{0.35ex}\Large\textbf -}}$\square$}
\newcommand{\checkboxChecked}{\rlap{\raisebox{0.2ex}{\hspace{0.35ex}\scriptsize \ding{52}}}$\square$}
#+end_src

We set up a maths typesetting preamble [[*Maths notation conveniences][later on]], but it would be nice to save it
to a variable here:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export :noweb-prefix no
(defvar org-latex-maths-preamble
  <<grab("latex-maths-conveniences")>>

In the "universal preamble", we already embed the source =.org= file, but it would
be nice to embed all the tangled files. This is fairly easy to accomplish by
mapping each tangled file to a form which embeds the file if it exists.
Considering we're going this far, why not add a dedicated =#+emded= keyword, so we
can embed whatever we want.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

Now all tangled files will be embedded, and we can embed arbitrary files like
so:
#+begin_src org
,#+embed: some-file :description flavour text about the file
#+end_src

This currently won't complete or anything like that, as we haven't told Org that
it's a keyword yet. It's also LaTeX-specific, so maybe it should be changed to
=#+latex_embed= or something like that.

***** Adding xcolor as an unconditional package

**** Maths notation conveniences
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:LaTeX: :noweb-ref latex-maths-conveniences
:END:

Maths has a way of popping up relentlessly. I think this says something both
about me and the subject itself. While the LaTeX set of commands is quite
reasonable, we can make a few common bits of notation a tad more convenient.

***** Packages

First, there are a few useful packages we want to use.

#+begin_src LaTeX
%% Maths-related packages
% More maths environments, commands, and symbols.
\usepackage{amsmath, amssymb}
% Slanted fractions with \sfrac{a}{b}, in text and maths.
\usepackage{xfrac}
% Visually cancel expressions with \cancel{value} and \cancelto{expression}{value}
\usepackage[makeroom]{cancel}
% Improvements on amsmath and utilities for mathematical typesetting
\usepackage{mathtools}
#+end_src

***** Custom delimiters

Next up we want to make the various types of rounding-related and absolute value
delimitors accessible as commands.

#+begin_src LaTeX
% Deliminators
\DeclarePairedDelimiter{\abs}{\lvert}{\rvert}
\DeclarePairedDelimiter{\norm}{\lVert}{\rVert}

\DeclarePairedDelimiter{\ceil}{\lceil}{\rceil}
\DeclarePairedDelimiter{\floor}{\lfloor}{\rfloor}
\DeclarePairedDelimiter{\round}{\lfloor}{\rceil}
#+end_src

***** Number sets

Then we have the various common number sets, it would be nice to have a
convenient way of typing them and optionally giving them powers. It's fairly
easy to support both =\XX= and =\XX[n]=.

#+begin_src LaTeX
\newcommand{\RR}[1][]{\ensuremath{\ifstrempty{#1}{\mathbb{R}}{\mathbb{R}^{#1}}}} % Real numbers
\newcommand{\NN}[1][]{\ensuremath{\ifstrempty{#1}{\mathbb{N}}{\mathbb{N}^{#1}}}} % Natural numbers
\newcommand{\ZZ}[1][]{\ensuremath{\ifstrempty{#1}{\mathbb{Z}}{\mathbb{Z}^{#1}}}} % Integer numbers
\newcommand{\QQ}[1][]{\ensuremath{\ifstrempty{#1}{\mathbb{Q}}{\mathbb{Q}^{#1}}}} % Rational numbers
\newcommand{\CC}[1][]{\ensuremath{\ifstrempty{#1}{\mathbb{C}}{\mathbb{C}^{#1}}}} % Complex numbers
#+end_src

***** Derivatives

Derivatives are actually a bit of a pain to typeset, it would be nice to have a
=\dv= command that supports:
+ =\dv{x}= for the derivative with respect to =x=
+ =\dv{f}{x}= for the derivative of =f= with respect to =x=
+ =\dv[2]{f}{x}= for the second order derivative of =f= with respect to =x=

Similarly, it would be nice to have a partial derivate counterpart =\pdv= which
behaves in a similar way, but with the possibility of providing multiple
comma-delimited variables --- e.g. =\pdv{f}{x,y,z}=.

#+begin_src LaTeX
% Easy derivatives
\ProvideDocumentCommand\dv{o m g}{%
  \IfNoValueTF{#3}{%
    \dv[#1]{}{#2}}{%
    \IfNoValueTF{#1}{%
      \frac{\dd #2}{\dd #3}%
    }{\frac{\dd[#1] #2}{\dd {#3}^{#1}}}}}
% Easy partial derivatives
\ExplSyntaxOn
\ProvideDocumentCommand\pdv{o m g}{%
  \IfNoValueTF{#3}{\pdv[#1]{}{#2}}%
  {\ifnum\clist_count:n{#3}<2
    \IfValueTF{#1}{\frac{\partial^{#1} #2}{\partial {#3}^{#1}}}%
    {\frac{\partial #2}{\partial #3}}
    \else
    \frac{\IfValueTF{#1}{\partial^{#1}}{\partial^{\clist_count:n{#3}}}#2}%
    {\clist_map_inline:nn{#3}{\partial ##1 \,}\!}
    \fi}}
\ExplSyntaxOff
#+end_src

***** Common operators

The default set of operators could benefit from a bit of expansion.

#+begin_src LaTeX
% Laplacian
\DeclareMathOperator{\Lap}{\mathcal{L}}

% Statistics
\DeclareMathOperator{\Var}{Var} % varience
\DeclareMathOperator{\Cov}{Cov} % covarience
\newcommand{\EE}{\ensuremath{\mathbb{E}}} % expected value
\DeclareMathOperator{\E}{E} % expected value
#+end_src

***** Slanted inequalities

As a matter of personal taste, I prefer the slanted less/greater than or equal
to operators, and would like to use them by default.

#+begin_src LaTeX
% I prefer the slanted \leq/\geq
\let\barleq\leq % Save them in case they're every wanted
\let\bargeq\geq
\renewcommand{\leq}{\leqslant}
\renewcommand{\geq}{\geqslant}
#+end_src

***** Alignment of matrix columns

By default, everything in a matrix is centred, which I actually find often
undesirable. It would be much nicer to take the alignment as an optional
argument of the environment, and default to right-alignment.

#+begin_src LaTeX
% Redefine the matrix environment to allow for alignment
% via an optional argument, and use r as the default.
\makeatletter
\renewcommand*\env@matrix[1][r]{\hskip -\arraycolsep%
    \let\@ifnextchar\new@ifnextchar
    \array{*\c@MaxMatrixCols #1}}
\makeatother
#+end_src

***** Slanted derivative "d"

Determining an appropriate styling for a derivative "d" (e.g. "dx") is
surprisingly hard, as the "d" is neither:
+ An operator (which are typeset as upright roman)
+ A variable (which are typeset as italic roman)

The ISO 80000-2 standard (2009) specifies that it should be upright, however (a)
it is still not an operator, (b) not used in any maths book I've seen, and (c)
doesn't look very good. I'm not entirely comfortable with the variable styling
either though, so perhaps something else is in order?

After trying a few different options, I rather like the idea of using a /slanted
roman "d"/. This stylistically works for me, while being just distinct enough
from other faces. As long as we are creating a PDF, we can apply a transform
that slants a "d".

#+begin_src LaTeX
% Slanted roman "d" for derivatives
\ifcsname pdfoutput\endcsname
  \ifnum\pdfoutput>0 % PDF
    \newsavebox\diffdbox{}
    \newcommand{\slantedromand}{{\mathpalette\makesl{d}}}
    \newcommand{\makesl}[2]{%
      \begingroup
      \sbox{\diffdbox}{$\mathsurround=0pt#1\mathrm{#2}$}%
      \pdfsave%
      \pdfsetmatrix{1 0 0.2 1}%
      \rlap{\usebox{\diffdbox}}%
      \pdfrestore%
      \hskip\wd\diffdbox%
      \endgroup}
  \else % DVI
    \newcommand{\slantedromand}{d} % fallback
  \fi
\else % Also DVI
  \newcommand{\slantedromand}{d} % fallback
\fi
#+end_src

Now there's the matter of /placing/ the "d", or rather adjusting the space around
it. After much fiddling, I've ended up with the following.

#+begin_src LaTeX
% Derivative d^n, nicely spaced
\makeatletter
\newcommand{\dd}[1][]{\mathop{}\!%
  \expandafter\ifx\expandafter&\detokenize{#1}&% \ifstrempty from etoolbox
    \slantedromand\@ifnextchar^{\hspace{0.2ex}}{\hspace{0.1ex}}
  \else
    \slantedromand\hspace{0.2ex}^{#1}
  \fi}
\makeatother
#+end_src

While =\dd= isn't much effort to type, it would be much cleaner to be able to do
src_LaTeX{\int x^2 \d x}. The problem with defining =\d= is that it is already used
for the under-dot accent. However, since this is a text-mode (only) accent, and
defined with src_LaTeX{\@dec@text@cmd\newcommand} instead of
src_LaTeX{\DeclareRobustCommand} we can redefine the command to mean =\dd= in
math-mode.

#+begin_src LaTeX
\NewCommandCopy{\daccent}{\d}
\renewcommand{\d}{\ifmmode\dd\else\daccent\fi}
#+end_src

**** Remove non-ascii chars

When using ~pdflatex~, almost non-ascii characters are generally problematic, and
don't appear in the pdf. It's preferable to see that there was /some/ character
which wasn't displayed as opposed to nothing.

We check every non-ascii character to make sure it's not a character encoded by
the =inputenc= packages when loaded with the =utf8= option. We'll also allow
box-drawing characters since they can be mostly supported with =pmboxdraw=.
Finally, we see if we have our own LaTeX conversion we can apply and if there is
none we replace the non-ascii char with =¿=.

No to make sure we only remove characters that can't be displayed, we check
=/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/base/utf8enc.dfu=.

We just need to make sure this is appended to the list of filter functions,
since we want to let emoji processing occur first.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

                                (lambda (nonascii)
                                  (if (string-match-p +org-pdflatex-inputenc-encoded-chars nonascii)
                                      nonascii
                                    (or (cdr (assoc nonascii +org-latex-non-ascii-char-substitutions))

Now, there are some symbols that aren't included in =inputenc=, but we should be
able to handle anyway. For them we define a table of LaTeX translations

**** Normal spaces after abbreviations

In LaTeX inter-word and sentence spaces are typically of different widths. This
can be an issue when using abbreviations i.e. e.g. etc. et al..
This can be corrected by forcing a normal space with src_LaTeX{\ }.
When exporting Org documents, we can add a filter to check for common
abbreviations and make the space normal.

**** Extra special strings

LaTeX already recognises =---= and =--= as em/en-dashes, =\-= as a shy hyphen, and the
conversion of =...= to =\ldots{}= is hardcoded into ~org-latex-plain-text~ (unlike
~org-html-plain-text~).

I'd quite like to also recognise =->= and =<-=, so let's set come up with some advice.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar org-latex-extra-special-string-regexps
  '(("<->" . "\\\\(\\\\leftrightarrow{}\\\\)")
    ("->" . "\\\\textrightarrow{}")
    ("<-" . "\\\\textleftarrow{}")))

(defun org-latex-convert-extra-special-strings (string)
  "Convert special characters in STRING to LaTeX."
  (dolist (a org-latex-extra-special-string-regexps string)
    (let ((re (car a))
          (rpl (cdr a)))
      (setq string (replace-regexp-in-string re rpl string t)))))

(defadvice! org-latex-plain-text-extra-special-a (orig-fn text info)
  "Make `org-latex-plain-text' handle some extra special strings."
  :around #'org-latex-plain-text
  (let ((output (funcall orig-fn text info)))
    (when (plist-get info :with-special-strings)
      (setq output (org-latex-convert-extra-special-strings output)))
    output))
#+end_src


**** Make verbatim different to code

Since have just gone to so much effort above let's make the most of it by making
=verbatim= use ~verb~ instead of ~protectedtexttt~ (default).

This gives the same advantages as mentioned in the [[*Make verbatim different to code][HTML export section]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-latex-text-markup-alist
      '((bold . "\\textbf{%s}")
        (code . protectedtexttt)
        (italic . "\\emph{%s}")
        (strike-through . "\\sout{%s}")
        (underline . "\\uline{%s}")
        (verbatim . verb)))

**** Check for required packages

Then for the various fontsets:
#+name: org-latex-font-packages-list
+ Alegreya
+ arev
+ biolinum
+ FiraMono
+ FiraSans
+ fourier
+ gillius
+ kpfonts
+ libertine

+ newpxtext
+ newtxmath
+ newtxtext
+ newtxsf
+ noto
+ plex-mono
+ plex-sans
+ plex-serif
+ sourcecodepro
+ sourcesanspro
+ sourceserifpro

We can write a function which will check for each of these packages with
=kpsewhich=, and then if any of them are missing we'll inject some advice into the
generated config that gets a list of missing packages and warns us every time we
export to a PDF.

*** Reveal export

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg org-re-reveal", after="org-re-reveal")

By default reveal is rather nice, there are just a few tweaks that I consider a
good idea.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-re-reveal-theme "white"
      org-re-reveal-transition "slide"
      org-re-reveal-plugins '(markdown notes math search zoom))
#+end_src

*** Markdown Export

#+call: confpkg("ox-md", after="ox-md")

**** GFM

#+call: confpkg("!Pkg ox-gfm")

Because of the /[[https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-spec/wiki/markdown-flavors][lovely variety in markdown implementations]]/ there isn't actually
such a thing a standard table spec ... or standard anything really. Because
~org-md~ is a goody-two-shoes, it just uses HTML for all these non-standardised
elements (a lot of them). So ~ox-gfm~ is handy for exporting markdown with all the
features that GitHub has.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle packages.el
(package! ox-gfm :pin "46faa67dbb3fb0cd7a76c3fe518f16e4195c22c7")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! ox-gfm
  :after ox)
#+end_src

**** Character substitutions

When I want to paste exported markdown somewhere
it can be preferable to have unicode characters for =---= etc. instead
of =&#x2014;=.

To accomplish this, we just need to locally rebind the alist which provides
these substitution.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-md-plain-text-unicode-a (orig-fn text info)
  "Locally rebind `org-html-special-string-regexps'"
  :around #'org-md-plain-text
  (let ((org-html-special-string-regexps
         '(("\\\\-" . "-")
           ("---\\([^-]\\|$\\)" . "—\\1")
           ("--\\([^-]\\|$\\)" . "–\\1")
           ("\\.\\.\\." . "…")
           ("<->" . "⟷")
           ("->" . "→")
           ("<-" . "←"))))
    (funcall orig-fn text (plist-put info :with-smart-quotes nil))))
#+end_src

In the future, I may want to check =info= to only have this active when =ox-gfm= is
being used.

Another worthwhile consideration is LaTeX formatting. It seems most Markdown
parsers are fixated on TeX-style syntax (=$= and =$$=). As unfortunate as this is,
it's probably best to accommodate them, for the sake of decent rendering.

=ox-md= doesn't provide any transcoders for this, so we'll have to whip up our own
and push them onto the =md= transcoders alist.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! ox-md
  (defun org-md-latex-fragment (latex-fragment _contents info)
    "Transcode a LATEX-FRAGMENT object from Org to Markdown."
    (let ((frag (org-element-property :value latex-fragment)))
      (cond
       ((string-match-p "^\\\\(" frag)
        (concat "$" (substring frag 2 -2) "$"))
       ((string-match-p "^\\\\\\[" frag)
        (concat "$$" (substring frag 2 -2) "$$"))
       (t (message "unrecognised fragment: %s" frag)
          frag))))

  (defun org-md-latex-environment (latex-environment contents info)
    "Transcode a LATEX-ENVIRONMENT object from Org to Markdown."
    (concat "$$\n"
            (org-html-latex-environment latex-environment contents info)
            "$$\n"))

  (defun org-utf8-entity (entity _contents _info)
    "Transcode an ENTITY object from Org to utf-8.
CONTENTS are the definition itself.  INFO is a plist holding
contextual information."
    (org-element-property :utf-8 entity))

  ;; We can't let this be immediately parsed and evaluated,
  ;; because eager macro-expansion tries to call as-of-yet
  ;; undefined functions.
  ;; NOTE in the near future this shouldn't be required
  (eval
   '(dolist (extra-transcoder
             '((latex-fragment . org-md-latex-fragment)
               (latex-environment . org-md-latex-environment)
               (entity . org-utf8-entity)))
      (unless (member extra-transcoder (org-export-backend-transcoders
                                        (org-export-get-backend 'md)))
        (push extra-transcoder (org-export-backend-transcoders
                                (org-export-get-backend 'md)))))))
#+end_src

*** Babel

#+call: confpkg("Org Babel")

Doom lazy-loads babel languages, with is lovely.
It also pulls in [[https://github.com/astahlman/ob-async][ob-async]], which is nice, but it would be even better if it was
used by default.

There are two caveats to =ob-async=:
1. It does not support =:session=
   + So, we don't want =:async= used when =:session= is set
2. It adds a fixed delay to execution
   + This is undesirable in a number of cases, for example it's generally
     unwanted with =emacs-lisp= code
   + As such, I also introduce a async language blacklist to control when it's
     automatically enabled

Due to the nuance in the desired behaviour, instead of just adding =:async= to
~org-babel-default-header-args~, I advice ~org-babel-get-src-block-info~ to add
=:async= intelligently. As an escape hatch, it also recognises =:sync= as an
indication that =:async= should not be added.

I did originally have this enabled for everything except for =emacs-lisp= and
=LaTeX= (there were weird issues), but this added  a ~3s "startup" cost to every
src block evaluation, which was a bit of a pain. Since =:async= can be added
easily with =#+properties=, I've turned this behaviour from a blacklist to a
whitelist.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-transient-hook! #'org-babel-execute-src-block
  (require 'ob-async))

(defvar org-babel-auto-async-languages '()
  "Babel languages which should be executed asyncronously by default.")

(defadvice! org-babel-get-src-block-info-eager-async-a (orig-fn &optional light datum)
  "Eagarly add an :async parameter to the src information, unless it seems problematic.
This only acts o languages in `org-babel-auto-async-languages'.

  :around #'org-babel-get-src-block-info
  (let ((result (funcall orig-fn light datum)))
    (when (and (string= "none" (cdr (assoc :session (caddr result))))
               (member (car result) org-babel-auto-async-languages)
               (not (assoc :async (caddr result))) ; don't duplicate

The symbols and modifies are very nice by default, but could do with a bit of
fleshing out. Let's change the prefix to a key which is similarly rarely used,
but more convenient, like =;=.

** Python

** Markdown

#+call: confpkg()

Most of the time when I write markdown, it's going into some app/website which
will do it's own line wrapping, hence we /only/ want to use visual line wrapping. No hard stuff.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook! (gfm-mode markdown-mode) #'visual-line-mode #'turn-off-auto-fill)
#+end_src

Since markdown is often seen as rendered HTML, let's try to somewhat mirror the
style or markdown renderers.

Most markdown renders seem to make the first three headings levels larger than
normal text, the first two much so. Then the fourth level tends to be the same
as body text, while the fifth and sixth are (increasingly) smaller, with the
sixth greyed out. Since the sixth level is so small, I'll turn up the boldness a notch.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  '(markdown-header-face-1 :height 1.25 :weight extra-bold :inherit markdown-header-face)
  '(markdown-header-face-2 :height 1.15 :weight bold       :inherit markdown-header-face)
